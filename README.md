# 🚀 30 Days of DevOps — My Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days of DevOps** journey, where I tackle daily DevOps challenges and build real skills fast. This repo captures my solutions, notes, and reflections as I complete **KodeKloud-style / DevOps-style tasks every day**.

---

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

* To deepen my understanding of DevOps tools and workflows
* To practice daily in a structured way
* To build a strong portfolio of real-world tasks and project examples
* To form a habit of learning and applying DevOps concepts

---

## 📅 My Challenge Rules

* Complete **one DevOps challenge each day**, for 30 days
* Document the solution in this repo
* Write notes / explanations for each task (how I solved it, issues faced)
* Use real tools whenever possible (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, IaC, etc.)
* Share my progress publicly to stay accountable

## 📂 Repo Structure

```
/30-Days-of-DevOps
    /Day-01
        README.md — summary of challenge + steps  
        solution/ — scripts, config files, Terraform / Kubernetes manifests etc.  
        notes.md — what I learned, problems I faced, key take-aways  
    /Day-02
    …  
    /Day-30
    final-project/
        …  
```

* **README.md** in each day’s folder describes the challenge, how I solved it, and any resources I used
* **solution/** contains code / config / scripts
* **notes.md** includes my reflections and lessons

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I’ll Use

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Kubernetes (k8s)
* Terraform / CloudFormation
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins or similar)
* Monitoring: Prometheus / Grafana
* Logging: ELK / Loki / etc.
* Version control: Git & GitHub
* Linux command line

## 🔥 My Goals for Day 30

By the end of this challenge, I want to:

1. Have a **portfolio** of 30 DevOps tasks/configs
2. Be confident with major DevOps tools
3. Understand how to build and deploy cloud-native apps
4. Build and document a **final project** that ties together everything I’ve learned

## 📚 Learning & Resources

Each day, I’ll reference:

* KodeKloud courses / tasks
* Official tool documentation
* Community tutorials / blog posts
* My own experimentation and trial & error

---

## 💬 How to Support / Follow Along

* **Star** this repo to follow my progress
* **Watch** it so you don’t miss updates
* **Fork** or clone — try the challenges yourself
* **Open Issues** or PRs if you spot a better way to solve something!

## ✨ Final Project

My **Day 30** will be dedicated to a **final capstone project** which ties together:

* Infrastructure as Code
* Containerization
* CI/CD
* Monitoring & logging

I’ll build something real — then document everything in this repo.
